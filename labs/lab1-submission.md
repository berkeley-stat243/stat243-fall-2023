# Submitting problem set solutions

You already have access to the following:

1. [Unix shell](../howtos/accessingUnixCommandLine.md)
2. [Git](../howtos/gitInstall.md)
3. [Quarto](../howtos/quartoInstall.md)
4. [Python](../howtos/accessingPython.md)
5. A text editor of your choice

Today we will use all these tools together to submit a solution for Problem set 0 (not a real problem set) to make sure you know how to submit solutions to upcoming (real) problem sets.

1. Create a folder in our respective github repositories.
2. Add a quarto document to it that has some simple code that creates a simple plot (use your imagination).
3. Use the quarto command line to render it into a pdf.
4. Add the padf to the repository.
5. Make sure that you can log into gradescope and upload a pdf.
