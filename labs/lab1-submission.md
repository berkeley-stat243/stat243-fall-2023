# Submitting problem set solutions

You already have access to the following 5 basic tools:

1. [Unix shell](../howtos/accessingUnixCommandLine.md)
2. [Git](../howtos/gitInstall.md)
3. [Quarto](../howtos/quartoInstall.md)
4. [Python](../howtos/accessingPython.md)
5. A text editor of your choice

Today we will use all these tools together to submit a solution for Problem set 0 (not a real problem set) to make sure you know how to submit solutions to upcoming (real) problem sets.

1. Create a folder in our respective github repositories.
2. Add a quarto document to it that has some simple code that creates a simple plot (use your imagination).
3. Use the quarto command line to render it into a pdf.
4. Add the padf to the repository.
5. Make sure that you can log into gradescope and upload a pdf.

We will also take today's lab as an opportunity to get familiar with the basic use of all the 5 basic tools listed above.
For git and quarto, very basic knowledge should be sufficient, but for unix commands and python, the more you learn the more effective you will be at solving the problem sets (and at any computational task you take on after that).
