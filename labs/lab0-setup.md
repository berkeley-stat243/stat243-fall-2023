# Setting up your environment

You will need to set up (or make sure you have access to) the following:

1. [Unix shell](../howtos/accessingUnixCommandLine.md)
2. git
3. quarto
4. [python](https://berkeley-stat243.github.io/stat243-fall-2023/howtos/accessingPython.html)

Attending lab 0 is optional. If you successfully set up your environment to have all the listed tools, you don't need to attend. You are welcome to attend to ask for help with the setup or to help your classmates with setting up their environments.

You are also welcome to come and ask for help on using any of these 4 tools/systems, but these questions will be answered after setup related questions.
