## Setting up your environment

You will need to set up (or make sure you have access to) the following:

1. [Unix shell](../howtos/accessingUnixCommandLine.md)
2. [Git](../howtos/gitInstall.md)
3. [Quarto](../howtos/quartoInstall.md)
4. [Python](../howtos/accessingPython.md)
5. A text editor of your choice (deeb recommends [sublime](https://www.sublimetext.com/) and [VS Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) to start)

Attending lab 0 is optional. If you successfully set up your environment to have all the listed tools, you don't need to attend. You are welcome to attend to ask for help with the setup or to help your classmates with setting up their environments.

You are also welcome to come and ask for help on using any of these 4 tools/systems, but these questions will be answered after setup related questions.

**Deeb's unsolicited advice for the week:** Whichever editor you pick, make sure to spend some time every week learning a few keyboard shortcuts for it. The same goes for the bash shell (ctrl+a and ctrl+e are among my favorites) and for your OS of choice in general. Not only do keyboard shortcuts make you more efficient, but they dramatically reduce the cognitive load after a while, and so make your life less painful in the long run.
