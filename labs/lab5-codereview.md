## Hands on steps for lab

1. Pair up in teams of 2 (or 3 if necessary).
2. One member of the team will create a new repository on github and invite the other teammember(s) as collaborators on the repo.
3. Using the Github web UI, each team member will create a new file in the repo, and paste their code for presidential speaches into it.
4. Commit you changes (from the github UI) as a pull request / separate branch.
5. Now each team member will go to the pull request made by another team member and look at the code changes.
6. Read eachother's code carefully and leave some thoughtful comments.
7. The comments may be about implementation details, efficiency concerns, or style and readability
8. Remember to be constructive and kind :)
