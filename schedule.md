## Notes on assignments and activities

- **Optional library LaTeX sessions**: I highly recommend (in particular if you are a Statistics graduate student) that you know how to create equations in LaTeX.
- **Optional Lab 0 software/command line help session**: (August 25 in Evans 340) Help session for installing software, accessing a UNIX-style command line, and basic UNIX usage (e.g., the UNIX basics tutorial). You should have software installed, be able to accesss the command line, and have started to become familiar with basic UNIX usage before class on Wednesday August 30.
- **Optional Python help session**: (location/time TBD) If you are not familiar with Python at the level of [the Python short course](TBD),
work through that material and the exercises. If you'd like help and an opportunity for extra practice,
please attend the special Python catch-up session listed above. You should do this by the end of the week of September 6.
- **Bash shell tutorial and exercises**: (by September 1), read through this [tutorial on using the bash shell](https://berkeley-scf.github.io/tutorial-using-bash). You can skip the pages on Regular Expressions and Managing Processes. Work through the first 10 problems in the [exercises](https://berkeley-scf.github.io/tutorial-using-bash/exercises) and submit your answers via Gradescope. This is not a formal problem set, so you don't need to worry about formatting nor about explaining/commenting your answers, nor do you need to put your answers in your GitHub class repository. In fact it's even fine with me if you hand-write the answers and scan them to an electronic document. I just want to make sure you've worked through the tutorial. I'll be doing demonstrations on using the bash shell in class starting on Wednesday August 30, so that will be helpful as you work through the tutorial.
- **Lab 1**: (September 1) First section/lab on using Git, setting up your GitHub repository for problem sets, and using Quarto to generate dynamic documents. **Please come only to the section you are registered for given space limits in the room, unless you have talked with Chris and have his permission.** 
- **Regular expression tutorial and exercises**: (by September 8), read the regular expression material in the [tutorial on using the bash shell](https://berkeley-scf.github.io/tutorial-using-bash/regex). Also read Section 1 of the 'basic text manipulation' page of the [string processing tutorial](https://berkeley-scf.github.io/tutorial-string-processing/basic-text-manipulation) (you can focus on Section 1.2 on stringr if you wish). Then answer the regular expressions (regex) [practice problems and submit your answers on Gradescope (UNDER CONSTRUCTION)](https://www.gradescope.com/courses/425343/assignments/XYZ). This is not one of the graded problem sets but rather an 'assignment' that will simply be noted as being completed or not.
