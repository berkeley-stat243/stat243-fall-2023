## Questions about taking the class

If you would like to audit the class, enroll as a UC Berkeley undergraduate, or enroll as a concurrent enrollment student (i.e., for visiting students), or for some other reason are not enrolled, please fill out [this survey](https://forms.gle/MxPviTJ2Lw1iJvn66) as soon as possible. All those enrolled or wishing to take the class should have filled it out by Friday August 25 at noon.

Undergraduates can only take the course with my permission and once all graduate students have an opportunity to register. I expect there will be space, and will likely start admitting undergraduates early the week of August 28 or late the previous week.

Concurrent enrollment students (e.g., exchange students from other universities/countries) can take the course with my permission and once all UC Berkeley students have had an opportunity to register. I expect there will be space, and will likely start admitting concurrent enrollment students early the week of August 28.

Please see the syllabus for the math and statistics background I expect, as well as the need to be familiar with Python or to get up to speed in Python during the first few weeks of the semester.

The first three weeks involve a lot of moving pieces, in part related to trying to get everyone up to speed with the bash shell and Python. Please use [the schedule](schedule) to keep on top of what you need to do.
