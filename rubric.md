This document provides guidance for submitting high-quality problem set (and project) solutions.
This guidance is based on general good practices for scientific communication, reproducible research, and software development.

## General presentation

- Simply presenting code or derivations is not sufficient.
- Briefly describe the overall goal or strategy before providing code/derivations.
- As needed describe what the pieces of your code/derivation are doing to make it easier for a reader to follow the steps.
- Keep your output focused on illustrating what you did, without distracting from the flow of your solution by showing voluminous output. The output should illustrate and demonstrate, not overwhelm or obscure. If you need to show longer output, you can add it at the end as supplemental material.
- Output should be produced by your code (i.e., from the code chunks running when the document is rendered), **not** by copying and pasting results into the document. 

## Coding practice

- Minimize (or eliminate) use of global variables.
- Break down work into core tasks and develop small, modular, self-contained functions (or class methods) to carry out those tasks.
- Don't repeat code. As needed refactor code to create new functions (or class methods).
- Functions and classes should be "weakly coupled", interacting via their interfaces and not by having to know the internals of how they work.
- Use data structures appropriate for the computations that need to be done.
- Don't hard code 'magic' numbers. Assign such numbers to variables with clear names, e.g., `speed_of_light = 3e8`.
- Provide reasonable default arguments to functions (or class methods) when possible.
- Provide tests (including unit tests) when requested (this is good general practice but we won't require it in all cases).
- Avoid overly complicated syntax -- try to use the clearest syntax you can to solve the problem.
- In terms of speed, don't worry about it too much so long as the code finishes real-world tasks in a reasonable amount of time. When optimizing, focus on the parts of the code that are the bottlenecks.
- Use functions already available in the language rather than recreating yourself.

## Code style

- Follow a consistent style. While you don't have to follow Python's [PEP8 style guide](https://peps.python.org/pep-0008/) exactly, please look at it and follow it generally. 
- Use informative variable and function names and have a consistent naming style. 
- Use whitespace (spaces, newlines) and parentheses to make the structure of the code easy to understand and the individual syntax pieces clear.
- Use consistent indentation to make the structure of the code easy to understand.
- Provide comments that give the goal of a given piece of code and why it does things, but don't use comments to restate what the code does when it should be obvious from reading the code.
  - Provide summaries for blocks of code.
  - For particularly complicated syntax, say what a given piece of code does.
